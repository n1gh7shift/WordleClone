A .NET Blazor Wordle Clone

I used this tutorial video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpby4HiElek&ab_channel=CodewithAniaKub%C3%B3w
to get the styling and the jist of the functionality and converted it to work with .NET 6 Blazor.

Also I used 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwgck1k0YKU&ab_channel=IAmTimCorey
to get the HTTP Client working correctly to request a new word and verify valid guesses.

Probably would have been easier and more fail safe to download Wordle's word list but this was just an exercise for me.
